# Python-Project Tic-Tac-Toe Game
## Project Overview:
### Your task is to develop the Tic-Tac-Toe game in python. You do not have to create a GUI for this task.
### The players should be able to participate using the command line interface

## Player input types:
### Each player just has to provide the location of the matrix where the player wants to put his/her mark.
### For example, if I want to put a ‘X’ mark at [1,2] location, then my input should be 1 2 (corresponding row and column separated by a space)
